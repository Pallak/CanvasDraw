USER MANUAL
	DRAWING SHAPES
	  -On the left menu select the "Draw" option
	  -On the top menu select desired shape type
	  	-To change shape's Outline Color/ Fill Color/ Outline Width, click on the respective input box, a drop down menu will appear.
	  -After selecting a shape, press the left mouse down on the canvas and draw to desired size, let go of left mouse button on having wanted size
	
	MOVING SHAPES
	  -On the left menu select the "Select" option
	  -For shapes other than "Line", select the shape by pressing the left mouse button down anywhere on the interior of desired shape
	  -For the "Line" shape, select the shape by pressing the left mouse button down on center square (control point)
	  -After selecting the shape, keep the left mouse button down and draw the shape to desired location
	  -Let go left mouse button after achieving desired location

	ALTERING SHAPES
	  -On the left menu select the "Select" option
	  -Every shape now has three squares (control points)
	  -To alter the size of the shape, left click the mouse button and hold one of the corner control points
	  -After obtaining desired alteration, release the left mouse button

	COPYING SHAPES
	  -On the left menu select the "Copy" option
	  -Left click on the shape you wish to copy
	  -Shape is now ready to be pasted

	PASTING SHAPES
	  -After following the steps from COPYING SHAPES, a shape is ready to be copied
	  -On the left menu select the "PASTE" option
	  -Left click anywhere on the canvas to paste the shape at that position

	ERASING SINGLE SHAPES
	  -On the left menu select the "Select" option
	  -Select a shape
	  -Left click on erase in the top menu

	CLEARING THE CANVAS
	  -Left click the "Clear Canvas" button in the left menu

OBJECT TYPES
	SHAPE
	  -Is the super class of all shapes, contains starting points (x, y), isSelected, outlineColor and outlineWidth variables
	  FUNCTIONS
	    -center: takes in no parameters, returns the center of the shape based on its member variables
	    -setSelected: takes in boolean variable, value. Sets the shape's isSelected variable to input
	    -inside: takes in two parameters; x, y. Returns an object, with a boolean, true if the x,y coordinates are inside any of the shape's control points and the type of control point that was hit.
	RECTANGLE
	  -Is a child class of Shape, contains same variables as object 'Shape', also contains end points (xEnd, yEnd), fillColor variables
	  FUNCTIONS
	    -draw: takes in no parameters, displays the shape on the canvas based on its member variables
	    -inside: takes in two parameters; x, y. Returns an object with a boolean, true if the x,y coordinates are inside the rectangle, otherwise false
	LINE
	  -is a child class of Shape, contains same variables as object 'Shape', also contains end points (xEnd, yEnd) variables
	  Functions:
	    -draw: takes in no parameters, displays the shape on the canvas based on its member variables
	CIRCLE
	  -Is a child class of Shape, contains same variables as object 'Shape', also contains end points (xEnd, yEnd), fillColor variables
	  FUNCTIONS
	    -draw: takes in no parameters, displays the shape on the canvas based on its member variables
	    -inside: takes in two parameters; x, y. Returns an object with a boolean, true if the x,y coordinates are inside the circle, otherwise false

HOW IT WORKS
	The application initially begins with an empty array of shapes. When the user creates a new shape by drawing it on the canvas,
	that shape gets appended to the array of shapes. The shapes are then drawing in order of the array, and hence the shapes at the
	end of the array get drawn last, and on top of all previous shapes. When select a shape, that shape's position in the array gets
	moved to the last one, as a result the shape ends up being on the upmost layer. For moving the shape, the application tracks the
	difference in coordiantes, and applies that changes to the x, y, xEnd, yEnd variables and then are re drawn. For copying, there is a global
	variable that tracks the last copied shape, when the user is ready to paste the application makes calculations to find the size of the shape
	and adjusts it's x, y, xEnd, yEnd variables accordingly.

DESIGN DECISIONS:
	- The line's colour depends on the outline colour and is not affected by the fill colour. It's width is controlled by outline width.
	- A shape can be selected by pressing down on any of its control points. However, pressing down and dragging on a control point
	  triggers an action depending on the type of control point. The center control point triggers move while the other two control 
	  points trigger alteration of the shape.
	- On selecting a shape in "Select" mode, the selected shape's colors and outline width are instantly displayed in the color pickers and the
	  outline width field. Likewise, changing any of the colors in the color pickers(on mouse down and move) is instantly reflected by the
	  selected shape. The shape's outline width is changed on clicking a value in the dropdown menu.
	- The selected shape is retained even if you change the menu option on the left menu. It is only set to null if you click on the canvas 
	  in "Select"/"Copy" mode. 
	- The "Select" and "Copy" mode share the selected shape. Changing the selected shape in either mode selects the shape and brings it to the 
	  front and the selection is reflected in both modes.
	- If a shape is selected in "Select" mode and then "Copy" is clicked on the left menu, the shape is automatically copied to the clipboard.
	- The shape copied to clipboard is retained even if you click on the canvas in "Select"/"Copy" mode. It is only changed if you select 
	  another shape.
	- Once "Paste" is selected from the left menu, the clipboard shape can be pasted as many times as desired. 
	- The "Copy"/"Paste" menus can be selected by using the keyboard shortcuts "Ctrl + c/v".
