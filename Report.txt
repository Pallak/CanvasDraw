	  -For shapes other than "Line", select the shape by pressing the left mouse button down anywhere on the interior of desired shape
	  -For the "Line" shape, select the shape by pressing the left mouse button down on center square
	  -After selecting the shape, keep the left mouse button down and draw the shape to desired location
	  -Let go left mouse button after achieving desired location

	ALTERING SHAPES
	  -On the left menu select the "Select" option
	  -Every shape now has three squares
	  -To alter the size of the shape, left click the mouse button and hold on of the corner squares
	  -After obtaining desired alteration, release the left mouse button

	  -Left click on the shape you wish to copy
	  -On the left menu select the "Copy" option
	  -Shape is now ready to be pasted

	PASTING SHAPES
	  -After following the steps from COPYING SHAPES, a shape is ready to be copied
	  -On the left menu select the "PASTE" option

OBJECT TYPES
	SHAPE
	  -Is the super class of all shapes, contains x, y, xEnd, yEnd, isSelected variables
	  FUNCTIONS
	    -center: takes in no parameters, returns the center of the shape
	    -setSelected: takes in boolean variable, value. Sets the shape's isSelected variable to input
	RECTANGLE
	  -Is a child class of Shape, contains same variables as object 'Shape'
	  FUNCTIONS
	    -draw: takes in no parameters, displays the shape on the canvas based on it's member variables
	    -inside: takes in two parameters; x, y. Returns a boolean, true if the x,y coordinates are inside the rectangle, otherwise false
	LINE
	  -is a child class of Shape, contains same variables as object 'Shape'
	  Functions:
	    -draw: takes in no parameters, displays the shape on the canvas based on it's member variables
	CIRCLE
	  -Is a child class of Shape, contains same variables as object 'Shape'
	  FUNCTIONS
	    -draw: takes in no parameters, displays the shape on the canvas based on it's member variables
	    -inside: takes in two parameters; x, y. Returns a boolean, true if the x,y coordinates are inside the circle, otherwise false

HOW IT WORKS
	The application initially begins with an empty array of shapes. When the user creates a new shape by drawing it on the canvas,
	that shape gets appended to the array of shapes. The shapes are then drawing in order of the array, and hence the shapes at the
	end of the array get drawn last, and on top of all previous shapes. When select a shape, that shape's position in the array gets
	moved to the last one, as a result the shape ends up being on the upmost layer. For moving the shape, the application tracks the
	difference in coordiantes, and applies that changes to the x, y, xEnd, yEnd variables and then are re drawn. For copying, there is a global
	variable that tracks the last copied shape, when the user is ready to paste the application makes calculations to find the size of the shape
	and adjusts it's x, y, xEnd, yEnd variables accordingly.
