Stuff we can mention in our report
- event.which not working in firefox
- what happens if you click down in the canvas and move the mouse out of the canvas area - it is the same for pixlr except when you move in (after clicking up outside) and click down, the shape disappears.
- weird bug where you click too often and move too fast that it misses the click up event - may have something to do with the canvas getting "selected"
